# Ye Old Reader

RSS reader for <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a>. Wanted to try out some "new" technologies and  create something useful. Among others I'm using the following libraries/technologies:

* Typescript
* React
* Mobx
* React-router 4
* Semantic-UI
* Create React App

Focus has been on mobile user experience.

## To get started
